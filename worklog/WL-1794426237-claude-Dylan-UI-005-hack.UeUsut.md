## Live summary
- Done: Claim created; implementation pending
- Decision: Own branch and worktree
- Why: Parallel work without touching the main checkout
- Failing: No validation run yet
- Commands: `python kit/.uak/tests/test_setup_prepare.py`
- Next: write the named tests with a local bare remote (empty, then with main) and the real `uak clock` and `uak lint`; see them fail (uak red); then add the schedule and publish endpoints to setup.py.
